## Why "Construct"?

In The Matrix, the Construct is the loading program where operators upload knowledge and skills. Neo learns kung fu in seconds. Morpheus explains, "This is the Construct. It's our loading program."

This playbook is our Construct. It's where we load up on how XION engineering works. Not just the technical stuff, but the human stuff too: how we communicate, how we help each other, how we make decisions.

> "I know kung fu."

Let's load you in.
