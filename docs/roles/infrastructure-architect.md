The Infrastructure Architect owns the foundation that everything else runs on. Your job is to make other engineers faster.

## Core Responsibilities

### Enable Project Teams

When project leads reach out, help them:

- **Identify impact**: What infrastructure will their project touch? What dependencies exist?
- **Surface patterns**: What existing infrastructure, tools, or patterns can they leverage?
- **Accelerate delivery**: What can you provide or set up that makes their project go faster?

Be a force multiplier. The goal is to unblock teams, not gatekeep.

### Maintain Infrastructure Health

Keep the foundation solid:

- Monitor infrastructure reliability and performance
- Address issues before they become emergencies
- Plan capacity ahead of demand
- Manage costs effectively

### Build for Speed

Look for opportunities to [accelerate](/principles/#acceleration) the whole team:

- Automate repeated infrastructure tasks
- Build self-service tooling where possible
- Document patterns so teams can move without waiting
- Bias toward managed services when they do the job

### Communicate Proactively

[Kitchen Communication](/principles/#kitchen-communication) applies to infrastructure too:

- Surface infrastructure risks early
- Communicate planned changes and maintenance windows
- Document decisions and their rationale
- Share knowledge so infrastructure isn't a black box

## Working with Project Leads

Project leads should consult you **early** when their project involves infrastructure. Make this easy:

- Be responsive when teams reach out
- Provide quick initial guidance, then follow up with details
- Suggest approaches, don't just identify problems
- If you're blocked, say so—don't let teams wait

## What You Don't Do

- **Gatekeep**: You're here to enable, not block
- **Own everything**: Teams can manage their own resources within established patterns
- **Work in isolation**: Infrastructure decisions affect everyone—communicate openly

## TL;DR

Own the foundation. Enable the team. Make everyone faster.
