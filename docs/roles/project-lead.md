# Project Lead

> "We consider it a success if a tool did the job at the time it was needed, and failure if delivery was too late."

As a project lead, you own your project from start to production. This is both a responsibility and an empowerment.

## You Have the Final Call

You are the technical decision-maker for your project. You don't need to wait for approval on:

- Architecture choices
- Implementation approaches
- Technical trade-offs
- Tool and library selection

If you're the lead, it's your call.

## Your Responsibilities

### Get It to Production

Your job is to shepherd the project all the way to production. Not just "code complete" but actually shipped, working, and in users' hands.

### Keep Status Updated

Update your project status in Linear weekly. This includes:

- Current progress
- Any blockers
- Risk level (on track, at risk, off track)

See [Project Updates](/processes/project-updates) for details.

### Raise the Flag

If something is bigger than expected, or you're blocked, say something. Raising the flag is **not** a failure. It's good leadership.

Signs you should raise the flag:
- Scope is larger than initially estimated
- You've been stuck on something for more than a day
- Dependencies are blocking you
- You need skills or knowledge you don't have

### Bring People In

You can and should bring in help when needed. You're the lead, not a solo act. Coordinate with teammates, delegate tasks, pair program.

### Coordinate with Design

For design decisions, work with the design lead. Reach out early on UI/UX work rather than after implementation.

## What This Means for Everyone

- **Respect the lead's decisions.** If someone is the project lead, their technical calls are the calls.
- **Support the lead.** If you see someone struggling, offer help. They might not ask (see [Asking for Help](/culture/asking-for-help)).
- **Be available.** Leads will need to collaborate across the team. Be responsive when someone reaches out.

## TL;DR

You're empowered. You're accountable. Ship it.
