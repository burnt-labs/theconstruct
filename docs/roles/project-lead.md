# Project Lead

As a project lead, you have **full ownership** of your project. This is both a responsibility and an empowerment.

## How You Become a Project Lead

You're the project lead if you're assigned as the **Lead** on a project in Linear. That's it. The assignment is the authority.

## Ownership & Decision-Making

You have the final call on technical decisions for your project. You don't need to wait for approval on:

- Architecture choices
- Implementation approaches
- Technical trade-offs
- Tool and library selection

Trust your judgment. You're close to the code, the software, and the user interface. You understand what should happen.

### Consult Early

Some decisions require early consultation to avoid rework and leverage existing patterns:

| If your project involves... | Consult with... | Why |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **UX or UI work** | [UX Design](/roles/design-engineer) | Ensure design consistency and get proper specs before implementation |
| **Infrastructure changes** | [Infrastructure](/roles/infrastructure-architect) | Identify infra impact, existing patterns, and resources that can accelerate your project |

Reach out at the **start** of your project, not when you're blocked. These conversations help you move faster, not slower.

## Core Responsibilities

### Deliver to Production

Your primary responsibility is to get your project all the way to production. This includes:

- Breaking down the work into manageable tasks
- Ensuring quality through code review and testing
- Coordinating with other team members as needed
- Driving the project to completion

Remember: we ship experiences, not code. A tool that ships on time and does the job is a success. Code that's late or ships without purpose is not.

### Communicate Status

Keep the team informed about your project's progress. [Kitchen Communication](/principles/#kitchen-communication) means we overcommunicate—it's praised, not a cause for embarrassment.

- **Update Linear weekly**: Post project updates so the team has visibility into current status
- **Use project channels**: Communicate in shared channels rather than DMs—we don't silo information
- **Flag blockers early**: If something is bigger than expected or you're blocked, surface it immediately. We're in the best position to help the quicker we know about it.
- **Clear ambiguity**: If directions or requirements are unclear, make an educated decision and communicate that decision back out

See [Project Updates](/processes/project-updates) for details on posting updates.

### Ask for Help

You don't have to do everything alone. As [Crewmates](/principles/#crewmates):

- Bring in teammates when you need support
- If your workload is unsustainable, speak up—time wasted is always worse than a bruised ego
- Feeling blocked by teammates should not be common. If it is, raise it.
- In an emergency, others can take over. Nothing should be blocked on a single person.

### Support Your Teammates

When you have capacity:

- Be available to help others on their projects, especially when your work overlaps
- Respond to requests for help in a timely manner
- Share context and knowledge that might be useful to others

### Build for Speed

Look for opportunities to [accelerate](/principles/#acceleration) delivery:

- Automate anything that requires repeated manual work or guidance
- Build or adopt tools that allow the team to deliver faster
- Bias toward outside tooling if it does the job, so we can focus on core differentiators
- Bias toward deprecating things that don't bring continued value

## What This Means for Everyone

- **Respect the lead's decisions.** If someone is the project lead, their technical calls are the calls.
- **Support the lead.** If you see someone struggling, offer help. They might not ask (see [Asking for Help](/culture/asking-for-help)).
- **Be available.** Leads will need to collaborate across the team. Be responsive when someone reaches out.

## TL;DR

You're empowered. You're accountable. Ship it.
