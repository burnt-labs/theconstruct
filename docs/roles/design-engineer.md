# UX Design

The Design Engineer owns the end-to-end user experience for critical surfaces. Your job is to deliver a cohesive, low-friction experience that unblocks adoption and scales with enterprise needs.

## Ownership

You have full ownership of UX/UI decisions for:

- Accounts dashboard
- Login and account management flows
- Authentication and OAuth-related user experiences
- Enterprise-facing initiatives

## Core Responsibilities

### Engage Early

Maintain regular, proactive contact with project leads to ensure UX considerations are surfaced **before implementation begins**.

- Don't wait to be asked—reach out when you see relevant projects starting
- Surface constraints and patterns early to prevent rework
- Be available when teams need design direction

### Provide Direction

Translate product intent and technical constraints into UX direction using whatever tools fit:

- Wireframes or mockups
- Flow diagrams
- Prototypes
- Written design briefs

The format matters less than clarity. Engineers should be able to execute without repeated clarification.

### Make Decisions

You are the final decision-maker for UX within your owned surfaces. Decisions should be grounded in:

- **Industry precedent** - Prioritize established enterprise design patterns over customization
- **Clear tradeoffs** - Document what you're choosing and why
- **Engineering feasibility** - Stay aware of system constraints

Make timely, documented decisions to unblock engineering execution.

### Ensure Consistency

Actively prevent divergent designs across owned surfaces:

- Maintain pattern libraries and component standards
- Push back on one-off solutions without strong rationale
- Review implementations to catch drift early

## Decision-Making Authority

Within agreed-upon product constraints, you are the final call on UX/UI for your surfaces.

When you make a decision:
- Document the rationale
- Communicate with enough clarity that engineers can execute
- Be available for questions without requiring repeated rework

## Working with Project Leads

Project leads should consult you **early** when their work touches your owned surfaces. Make this easy:

- Be responsive when teams reach out
- Provide quick initial direction, then follow up with details
- If you're blocked or need more context, say so

## Performance

What good looks like:

- **Decision quality** - Choices grounded in best practices and clear tradeoffs
- **Speed to convergence** - Design direction finalized quickly, not dragged out
- **Consistency** - UX outcomes are cohesive across all owned surfaces

## TL;DR

Own the experience. Engage early. Decide fast. Keep it consistent.
