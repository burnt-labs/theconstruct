# Time Off

We're a multinational, multicultural team. Take your time off.

## Holidays

We respect that holidays vary by country and culture. Take the holidays that matter to you. There's no universal holiday calendar—observe what's meaningful to you.

## Expectations

Whether it's vacation, holidays, or any other time off:

- **Block your calendar** - Mark time off as "Out of Office" in your calendar so the team knows you're unavailable.
- **Communicate ahead** - Let your team know before you're out, especially for extended time off.
- **Hand off active work** - If you're leading a project, ensure coverage or pause updates (see [Project Lifecycle](/processes/project-lifecycle)).
- **Disconnect** - When you're off, be off. Don't check Slack.

## Coverage

Nothing should be blocked on one person. If you're out:
- Active projects should have someone who can answer questions
- Urgent issues should have a point of contact
- This doesn't mean doing extra work before leaving—just communicate who can help

## TL;DR

Block your calendar. Tell your team. Disconnect.
