# Communication

How we communicate affects how well we work together. Default to transparency.

## Default to Channels

**Use project or team channels instead of DMs** for work-related discussions.

### Why?

- **Context for the future**: Searchable history for you and others
- **Visibility**: Teammates see what's happening without asking
- **Unblocking**: Someone else might have the answer faster
- **Learning**: Others learn from discussions they can see
- **Continuity**: If someone is out, the thread is still accessible

### When DMs Are OK

- Personal or sensitive matters
- Quick 1:1 clarifications that don't affect others
- Initial outreach before moving to a channel

### When to Use Channels

- Technical questions
- Project discussions
- Decisions that affect the codebase
- Anything someone else might benefit from seeing

## Channel Guidelines

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| Project channels | Project-specific discussions |
| Team channels | General team discussions |
| Public channels | Cross-team visibility |

If a project doesn't have a channel and needs one, create it.

## Reducing Information Silos

Ask yourself before sending a DM:
- Would this be useful for someone else to see?
- Might I need to reference this later?
- Could someone else on the team help with this?

If yes to any of these, use a channel.

## TL;DR

Default to channels. DMs create silos. [Kitchen Communication](/principles/#kitchen-communication) means yelling things out as they happen—transparency helps the whole team.
