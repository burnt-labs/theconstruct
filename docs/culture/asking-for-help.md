Asking for help is not a weakness. It's a skill.

## Asking for Help

### You're Not a Nuisance

Asking for help is **expected**. You're not bothering anyone. We're a team.

When you stay stuck silently:
- You burn time
- Others can't help
- The project slips
- You stress yourself out

When you ask for help:
- Problems get solved faster
- Others feel useful
- Knowledge spreads
- We ship together

### When to Ask

Ask for help when:
- You've been stuck for more than a few hours
- You're unsure about an approach
- You need context you don't have
- You're overwhelmed

Don't wait until you're drowning.

### How to Ask

1. Describe what you're trying to do
2. Share what you've tried
3. Be specific about what you need

Post in a channel, DM someone, or bring it up in standup.

## Offering Help

### You're Not Stepping on Toes

Offering help is **welcome**. It's not an insult to someone's ability.

> "Hey, I have some bandwidth—want me to pick that up?"

This is a kind gesture, not a threat.

### When to Offer

Offer help when:
- You see someone struggling
- You have relevant experience
- You have capacity
- A project update shows "at risk" or "off track"

### How to Offer

- Be specific: "I could take the API endpoint piece if that helps"
- Be genuine: Only offer if you can actually follow through
- Accept "no": They might have it handled

## Proactive Check-Ins

It's OK to reach out to someone and ask how they're doing. If you sense someone is overwhelmed:
- Reach out directly
- Offer to take something off their plate
- Don't wait for them to ask

## The Crewmate Mindset

We operate less as a corporate pyramid, but more as the [crew of a ship](/principles/#crewmates). That means:
- Asking for help when you need it
- Offering help when you can
- Checking in on each other
- Nothing is blocked on a single person

Nobody ships alone.

## TL;DR

Ask for help early. Offer help freely. You're not a nuisance. You're not stepping on toes. We're a crew.
