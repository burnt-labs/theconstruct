# Engineering Principles

These are the core beliefs that guide how we work as XION engineers.

## Crewmates

**We operate less as a corporate pyramid, but more as the crew of a ship.**

- You must be able to trust your teammates to do their job to the highest level.
- In an emergency, there are several others who can take over on a task. Nothing is blocked on a single person.
- Feeling blocked by other teammates and unable to progress should not be common.
- If you are stuck for an extended period, ask for help. **Time wasted is always worse than a bruised ego.** Crewmates will always be willing to help.
- Everyone should have enough information to make smart, autonomous decisions.

## Kitchen Communication

**When things are sharp, burning, unstable and frantic; it's better to yell things out as they happen.**

- Overcommunication is praised, not a cause for embarrassment.
- We don't silo information.
- **Communicate early.** If a project will be delivered late or an unforeseen blocker is uncovered, we are in the best position the quicker we know about it.
- Mistakes happen, and are easiest to remediate if surfaced ASAP.
- If directions or requirements are ambiguous, make an educated decision that clears the ambiguity and communicates that decision back out.
- We depend on bottom-up reporting and confidence that teammates will surface issues as they are discovered. The organization can't scale if it has to be micromanaged top-down.

## Acceleration

**The only way you win if you are smaller, is by being faster. Automation compounds our ability to deliver.**

- We build tools to allow ourselves to work faster.
- Anything that requires repeated manual work or guidance should be automated as soon as possible.
- Tooling that allows the team or external parties to deliver products faster is prioritized.
- Automation is an investment that pays off forever.

## Phalanx

**A strong position when working together, but crumbles with internal dysfunction.**

- We are taking extremely difficult tasks, in large numbers and constant flux, with a team that is 1/10th the size of our competitors. This structure *only* works if we work together, not against each other.
- Any interpersonal issues or disagreements should be surfaced and resolved immediately, so we can continue focusing on external challenges.
- Teammates should always feel confident to approach each other or leadership to resolve issues.

## We Ship Experiences, Not Code

**In the shifting sands of this industry and market, it's expected that a great deal of the products or tools we spin up may be irrelevant or outdated quickly.**

- We consider it a success if a tool did the job at the time it was needed, and failure if delivery was too late.
- We bias toward deprecating things that don't bring us continued value. We take enjoyment in deleting code and products that aren't force multipliers.
- We bias toward outside tooling if it does the job, so we can focus on the core differentiators that make our business model unique and powerful.
- Code should be backed by design and purpose, not simply created for the sake of it.
- **We win when the applications built on top of us win.**

## Living Document

These principles aren't carved in stone. They evolve as we do. If something here doesn't match how we actually work—or how we should work—speak up.
