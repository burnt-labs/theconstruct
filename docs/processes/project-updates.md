# Project Updates

> "Communicate early. If a project will be delivered late or an unforeseen blocker is uncovered, we are in the best position the quicker we know about it."

Keeping projects updated in Linear gives everyone visibility into what's happening across the team.

## Why Updates Matter

When projects aren't updated:
- Teammates can't help
- Leads feel isolated
- Work happens in silos

When projects are updated:
- Everyone knows what's happening
- People with capacity can jump in
- Problems surface early

## Weekly Updates

Every active project needs a status update **at least once per week**.

### How to Post an Update

1. Go to your project in Linear
2. Click "Add update" or use the project pulse
3. Include:
   - What was accomplished this week
   - What's planned for next week
   - Any blockers or risks
   - Overall status (on track / at risk / off track)

### Project Statuses

Use Linear's project statuses to reflect current state:

| Status | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **Blocked** | Cannot proceed—add a comment explaining why |
| **External Partner Building** | Waiting on external party |

**Don't be afraid to mark something Blocked.** This is how we get help to where it's needed. See [Using Linear](/processes/linear) for all statuses.

## Where Updates Show Up

- In Slack (automatic notification)
- In Linear's project pulse view
- In the general project overview

## Reminders

You should receive a Slack reminder if you're assigned to a project. If you're not getting reminders, check your Linear notification settings.

## TL;DR

Update your projects in Linear weekly. Mark status honestly. The organization can't scale if it has to be micromanaged top-down—we depend on [bottom-up reporting](/principles/#kitchen-communication).
