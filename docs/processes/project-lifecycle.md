# Project Lifecycle

Projects don't always end with a ship. Sometimes they get cancelled, paused, or handed off. Handle these transitions intentionally.

## Cancelling a Project

Cancelling a project is not a failure—it's a decision. Continuing to invest in something that won't deliver value is the real failure.

### When to Consider Cancelling

- The original need no longer exists
- A better solution has emerged
- The cost to complete exceeds the value delivered
- Dependencies have shifted and the project no longer makes sense

### How to Cancel

1. **Communicate the decision** - Announce in the project channel and update Linear. Don't let it quietly fade.
2. **Document the why** - Leave a clear note explaining why the project was cancelled. Future you will thank you.
3. **Clean up** - Close related issues, archive branches, remove any half-deployed infrastructure.
4. **Capture learnings** - If there's anything valuable from the work, document it or extract it before archiving.

## Pausing a Project

Sometimes a project needs to pause rather than cancel—priorities shift, dependencies aren't ready, or bandwidth is needed elsewhere.

### How to Pause

1. **Mark status in Linear** - Set project to "Paused" or "On Hold" with a clear update explaining why.
2. **Document current state** - Where did you leave off? What's the next step when it resumes?
3. **Set a check-in date** - Don't let paused projects drift indefinitely. Set a date to revisit.
4. **Communicate** - Let stakeholders know the project is paused and why.

## Handing Off a Project

When a project lead changes, make the transition smooth.

### Before the Handoff

The outgoing lead should:

1. **Update all documentation** - Ensure Linear, PRs, and any project docs are current.
2. **Write a handoff doc** - Summarize:
   - Current state and progress
   - Key decisions made and why
   - Open questions or blockers
   - What's next
3. **Schedule a walkthrough** - Meet with the new lead to transfer context.
4. **Introduce connections** - Ensure the new lead knows who the stakeholders and collaborators are.

### During the Handoff

1. **Reassign in Linear** - Update the project lead assignment.
2. **Transfer ownership** - Access to relevant resources, channels, and systems.
3. **Overlap period** - If possible, have both leads available for questions during the first week.

### After the Handoff

The new lead should:

1. **Confirm understanding** - Verify the handoff doc matches reality.
2. **Post an update** - Announce the transition and any changes to approach.
3. **Ask questions** - Don't assume—reach out to the previous lead if anything is unclear.

## Archiving Completed Projects

When a project ships, close it out properly:

1. **Mark as complete in Linear** - Update status and add a final summary.
2. **Celebrate the win** - Share in Slack. We ship experiences—acknowledge it.
3. **Capture learnings** - What went well? What would you do differently?
4. **Clean up** - Close stale issues, merge or delete branches, remove temporary infrastructure.

## TL;DR

End projects intentionally. Communicate clearly. Leave a trail for the next person.
